# Local STT sidecar

Implements the HTTP contract described in upstream's `docs/LOCAL-STT.md` — designed
there, never built. The Go side posts raw PCM, gets a transcript back, and no audio
leaves the machine.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r sidecar/requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python sidecar/whisper_server.py \
    --model-en <mlx-model-or-hf-repo> \
    [--model-fr <mlx-model-or-hf-repo>] \
    [--second-opinion [--fr-detector <multilingual-mlx-model> [--fr-threshold 0.1]] [--fr-no-fallback [--fr-cut-loops]]] \
    [--save-audio <dir> [--save-audio-min-free-gb 8]]
```

`GET /health` reports which languages are served. `POST /transcribe` takes raw
`s16le` PCM (or a WAV container) with `X-Sample-Rate`, `X-Channels`, `X-Language`
and `X-Frequency-Id` (and optionally `X-Created-At` / `X-Segment-At`, see the
archive below), and returns the transcript plus `duration`,
`speech_seconds`, `realtime_factor`, and `rejected` when nothing was transcribed.

## Two departures from the upstream design, both measured

**A voice-activity gate in front of the model.** On this station up to 98% of
night-time squelch openings carry no speech. Whisper fed near-silence does not
return an empty string, it invents a plausible one — `"Thank you."` over 2.2s of
noise. Silero costs ~10ms and answers `rejected: "no_speech"` instead.

**Language routing with a refusal path.** An English ATC model fed French audio
produces fluent, confident, wrong English. Same 7.5s clip from a French flying
club tower, same server, only the routing differs:

```
X-Language: fr  →  "Fox Alpha Charlie, 28 au tourisme d'atterrissage, vent 282,
                    5 kt. On atterrit, piste 28, Fox Alpha Charlie."
X-Language: en  →  "lufthansa seven eight two so request heading five one two seven
                    climbing ten eight five to lufthansa seven eight two lufthansa…"
```

The second is not noise — it is well-formed ATC English that a downstream
post-processor will happily turn into a clearance for an aircraft that exists.
When the expected language has no model configured the server returns
`rejected: "no_model_for_fr"` and an empty transcript, which is the only safe
answer.

`X-Language` is the caller's expectation, taken from the frequency catalogue, and
it is honoured rather than second-guessed: measured language detection is wrong on
16% of French and 28% of English transmissions here, and its failures cluster on
clips that hold no usable speech anyway.

## No initial prompt by default

Upstream's transcription prompt is 150 words written for a continuous realtime
stream. On isolated 3-second transmissions it measurably hurts: sevenfold more
degeneration loops on French, decode time doubled, and the prompt text leaking
into the transcript (`"Aircraft are at cruise level and use ICA-7, Yankee Papa…"`).
See `docs-fr/10-mesure-amorces.md`.

## Second opinion and its gate

With `--second-opinion` and a French model, a transmission transcribed in English
is read again by the French model when the English text carries a French word
("bonjour", "niveau", "descendez"...). With `--fr-detector`, a multilingual
Whisper not fine-tuned on English (e.g. `whisper-large-v3-turbo`) also opens it
when its language detection gives French a probability of at least
`--fr-threshold`: the English model turns much French into English, and then no
French word is left to find. The detector only runs when no French word opened
the gate. This is not the language routing the paragraph above refuses: the
primary transcript still uses the language the caller asked for.

The response says which gate opened (`second_gate`: `words` or `detector`) and
the detector's probability (`p_fr`, when it ran); `/health` counts the second
opinions the detector opened (`second_opinion_by_detector`) and its failures
(`detector_failed`). All model work runs on one thread: MLX ties lazily created
arrays to the thread that created them.

`--fr-no-fallback` reads French once, at temperature 0, instead of mlx_whisper's
fallback of up to six decodes at rising temperature. The fallback fires on the
French model's loops: on two benches it made the mean French read 3.8 and 2.7 s,
against 1.8 and 1.4 s without it, for the same matches within one aircraft. But the
fallback is also what broke those loops: without it, 22.4 and 12.0 % of French texts
loop, against 9.8 and 4.8 %. `--fr-cut-loops` cuts them after the model, where a run
of words repeats back to back (`loops.py`: a word four times in a row, a group of two
to eight words three times), bringing them to 4.2 and 2.5 %. The manifest keeps the
uncut text (`texte_second_brut`). Not applied to the English reading, where the cut
cost true matches.

## The audio archive

`--save-audio <dir>` keeps every transmission exactly as it arrived, before
resampling, rejected ones included, as `<dir>/<YYYYMMDD>/<frequency>/t_*.wav`,
with one manifest per day, `<dir>/<YYYYMMDD>/manifeste.jsonl`. A line holds:
- the texts (`texte`, `texte_second`), the gate (`porte`) and `p_fr`;
- `speech_seconds`, and `rejected` for a clip the voice gate dropped;
- per decoded segment, `temperature`, `compression_ratio`, `avg_logprob` and
  `no_speech_prob`, for both readings (`segments`, `segments_second`). A
  temperature above 0 marks a segment the fallback re-read, which is how a loop
  shows;
- `recu_utc`, when the sidecar received it;
- `created_at` and `segment_at_utc`, when the caller sends `X-Created-At` and
  `X-Segment-At`. co-atc sends the date its database row will carry, so a clip
  joins its transcription exactly. Under a queue, the sidecar sees a transmission
  up to a minute after it ended.

Archiving stops, and transcription goes on, when free space falls below
`--save-audio-min-free-gb`.
