"""Local speech-to-text sidecar for atc-scribe.

Implements the HTTP contract described in upstream's `docs/LOCAL-STT.md`, which
was designed but never built: the Go side posts raw PCM and gets a transcript
back, so the audio pipeline stays unchanged and no audio leaves the machine.

Two things are deliberately added to that design, and both come from measurement
on a real station rather than from taste:

  1. A voice-activity gate in front of the model. Up to 98% of night-time squelch
     openings carry no speech, and Whisper fed near-silence does not return an
     empty string — it invents a plausible one.

  2. Language routing with a refusal path. An English ATC model fed French audio
     produces fluent, confident, wrong English: "cleared to land runway zero five"
     over a French flying club. Passed downstream, that fabricates a landing
     clearance for a real aircraft on the map. When the expected language has no
     model configured, this server returns an empty transcript and says why,
     which is the only safe answer.

Run:
    python sidecar/whisper_server.py --model-en <mlx-model> [--model-fr <mlx-model>]
